PWS

PWS is to provide a windows forms like interface except tailored towards the 
needs of stonerkart. It should contain all the widgets nessecary for all the
graphics components. Widgets should be completely agnostic as to the internal 
logic and data structures of stonerkart and should be updated via a message 
sending interface.



Game State

The complete game state is to be run on the server side as well as the client 
side. The user interact with a PWS window in order to make in game decisions 
such as which card to cast or which colour of mana to gain. This choice is 
then sent to the server which sends it to the other players in the game. 



Game Controller

Provides an interface by which one can manipulate the game state. Events 
manupulate game state; inputs are choices made by users. 



Cards

Cards are defined using a native C# esque scripting language.



Server

The server is to manage all user information, collections and currencies,
friends, messaging, matchmaking.
